>			Data queries are not a replacement for data input methods in Cacti. Instead they provide an easy way to
			query, or list data based upon an index, making the data easier to graph. The most common use of a data query
			within Cacti is to retrieve a list of network interfaces via SNMP. If you want to graph the traffic of a network
			interface, first Cacti must retrieve a list of interfaces on the host. Second, Cacti can use that
			information to create the necessary graphs and data sources. Data queries are only concerned with the
			first step of the process, that is obtaining a list of network interfaces and not creating the graphs/data
			sources for them. While listing network interfaces is a common use for data queries, they also have other
			uses such as listing partitions, processors, or even cards in a router.
		</P
><P
>			One requirement for any data query in Cacti, is that it has some unique value that defines each row in the list.
			This concept follows that of a 'primary key' in SQL, and makes sure that each row in the list can be uniquely
			referenced. Examples of these index values are 'ifIndex' for SNMP network interfaces or the device name for
			partitions.
		</P
><P
>			There are two types of data queries that you will see referred to throughout Cacti. They are script
			queries and SNMP queries. Script and SNMP queries are virtually identical in their functionality and
			only differ in how they obtain their information. A script query will call an external command or
			script and an SNMP query will make an SNMP call to retrieve a list of data.
		</P
><P
>			All data queries have two parts, the XML file and the definition within Cacti. An XML file must be
			created for each query, that defines where each piece of information is and how to retrieve it. This
			could be thought of as the actual query. The second part is a definition within Cacti, which tells
			Cacti where to find the XML file and associates the data query with one or more graph templates.
