>			In addition to giving you the tools to create sophisticated graphs, Cacti enables you to create users
			that are tailored specifically to their requirements. Each user has certain settings such as login
			actions, as well as graph viewing settings. There are also two levels of permissions control, realm
			permissions and graph permissions which enable you to control what the user can see and change.

>			Out of the box, there are two users that come with every Cacti installation. The "admin" user, is the
			main user that by default has access to see and change everything in Cacti. This is the user that you
			first login with in Cacti, and is probably a good idea to keep around unless you know otherwise. The
			second user is the "guest" user, which controls which areas/graphs are allowed for unauthenticated
			users. By default this user only has rights to view, but not change all graphs. This enables any
			unauthenticated user to visit 'graph_view.php' and view your graphs. This behavior can be changed by
			either changing the realm permissions for the "guest" user, or disabling the guest user altogether
			under <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Cacti Settings</SPAN
>.  By default in 0.8.7 and later, the "guest" user is not
			set in the setting, effectively disabling "guest" (Unauthenticated) access to Cacti.

					want to edit the permissions for. The <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Realm Permissions</SPAN
> box will be displayed
					in the lower part of the screen. Each "realm" is a grouping that represents common tasks in Cacti,
					making it easier to fine tune each user's access.
				</P
><P
>					If you want to create a user that can only view graphs, you should select the <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>View
					Graphs</SPAN
> realm and leave everything else unchecked. See the <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Graph
					Permissions</SPAN
> section for more information about how to fine tune this even more on a per-graph
					basis. Conversely, if the user needs to access the console, they will need <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"

					Access</SPAN

>					Graph permissions control which graphs a user is allowed to view, it does not apply to editing graphs.
					You can edit a user's graph permissions by selecting <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>User Management</SPAN
> and choosing
					the user you want to edit the permissions for. Now select the <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Graph Permissions</SPAN
> tab
					to view this user's graph permissions. There are three different ways that you can apply graph permissions,
					by graph, by host, or by graph template. This works by allowing or denying the user to all graphs associated
					with the particular group. So you can deny a user to a single graph, all graphs associated with a particular
					host, or all graphs associated with a particular graph template. Combining these three types of assigning
					graph permissions results in a very powerful graph policy editor.
				</P
><P
>					Each assignment type contains a <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Default Policy</SPAN
> dropdown which can be used to control
					whether the user should be allowed to view everything or be denied from everything by default in the particular
					group. It is very important to remember that these policies are evaluated in the order: graph, host, graph
					template. Therefore, if you set graph's default policy to <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Deny</SPAN
>, but kept host and graph
					template at <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Allow</SPAN
>, the user's effective policy would be <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Deny</SPAN
> since
					the graph assignment type is evaluated first. You typically either want to set all default policies to
					<SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Deny</SPAN
> for a restrictive user, or <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Allow</SPAN
> for a non-restrictive user.
					If you thoroughly understand Cacti's graph permissions system, these default policies can be combined to provide
					very complex results.

					way. These preferences controls things such as the preview graph size or the default graph viewing mode to use.
					In addition to managing these settings here under user management, each user can change their own settings by
					clicking on the <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Graphs</SPAN
> tab and selecting the <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"

					following page. If you want to prevent a user from being able to keep their own graph preferences, uncheck the
					<SPAN

>Allow this User to Keep Custom Graph Settings</SPAN
> checkbox in user management. The user will be
					presented with an "Access Denied" error message if they attempt to click the <SPAN
