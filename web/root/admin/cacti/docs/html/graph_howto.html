              MD5 and SHA are the authentication types to use.  DES and AES are the privacy
              protocols  to  use. If  the  privacy  passphrase  is not specified, it is assumed
              to be the same as the authentication passphrase.  Note that the users created will
              be useless unless they are also added  to  the  VACM access control tables
              described above.

              SHA  authentication  and DES/AES privacy require OpenSSL to be installed and the
              agent to be built with OpenSSL support.  MD5 authentication may be used without
              OpenSSL.

>VACM Configuration</B
>
       The full flexibility of the VACM is available using four configuration directives -
       com2sec, group,  view and access.  These provide direct configuration of the underlying
       VACM tables.

       com2sec  [-Cn CONTEXT] SECNAME SOURCE COMMUNITY
              map  an  SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c community string to a security name - either from a
              particular range of source addresses, or globally ("default").  A restricted
              source can either be a specific  hostname (or  address),  or  a  subnet -
              represented as IP/MASK (e.g. 10.10.10.0/255.255.255.0), or IP/BITS
              (e.g. 10.10.10.0/24), or the IPv6 equivalents.

              The same community string can be specified in several separate directives
              (presumably with different  source  tokens), and the first source/community
              combination that matches the incoming request will be selected.  Various
              source/community combinations can also map to the same security name.

              If a CONTEXT is specified (using -Cn), the community string will be mapped
              to a security  name  in the named SNMPv3 context. Otherwise the default
              context ("") will be used.

       group GROUP {v1|v2c|usm} SECNAME
              maps  a  security name (in the specified security model) into a named group.
              Several group directives can specify the same group name, allowing a single
              access setting to apply to several  users and/or community strings.

              Note  that  groups must be set up for the two community-based models separately -
              a single com2sec (or equivalent) directive will typically be accompanied by two
              group directives.

       view VNAME TYPE OID [MASK]
              defines a named "view" - a subset of the overall OID tree. This is most commonly
              a single subtree, but  several view directives can be given with the same view
              name, to build up a more complex collection of OIDs.  TYPE is either included
              or excluded, which can again define a more complex view (e.g by excluding certain
              sensitive objects from an otherwise accessible subtree).

              MASK is a list of hex octets (separated by <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"."</SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>":"</SPAN
>)
              with the set bits indicating which subidentifiers in the view OID to match against.
              This can be used to define a view covering a particular row  (or  rows) in a table.
              If not specified, this defaults to matching the OID exactly (all bits set), thus
              defining a simple OID subtree.

       access GROUP CONTEXT {any|v1|v2c|usm} LEVEL PREFX READ WRITE NOTIFY
              maps from a group of users/communities (with a particular security model
              and  minimum  security level, and in a specific context) to one of three views,
              depending on the request being processed.

              LEVEL is one of noauth, auth, or priv.  PREFX specifies how CONTEXT should be
              matched against  the context  of  the  incoming  request, either exact or prefix.
              READ, WRITE and NOTIFY specifies the view to be used for GET*, SET and
              TRAP/INFORM requests (althought the NOTIFY view is not currently used).  For
              v1 or v2c access, LEVEL will need to be noauth.</SPAN
