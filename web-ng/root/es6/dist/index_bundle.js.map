For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n   *\n   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n   *     }\n   *\n   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   */\n  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  function deepEqual(a, b) {\n    if (a === b) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    if (\n      !isIterable(b) ||\n      a.size !== undefined && b.size !== undefined && a.size !== b.size ||\n      a.__hash !== undefined && b.__hash !== undefined && a.__hash !== b.__hash ||\n      isKeyed(a) !== isKeyed(b) ||\n      isIndexed(a) !== isIndexed(b) ||\n      isOrdered(a) !== isOrdered(b)\n    ) {\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    if (a.size === 0 && b.size === 0) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    var notAssociative = !isAssociative(a);\n\n    if (isOrdered(a)) {\n      var entries = a.entries();\n      return b.every(function(v, k)  {\n        var entry = entries.next().value;\n        return entry && is(entry[1], v) && (notAssociative || is(entry[0], k));\n      }) && entries.next().done;\n    }\n\n    var flipped = false;\n\n    if (a.size === undefined) {\n      if (b.size === undefined) {\n        if (typeof a.cacheResult === 'function') {\n          a.cacheResult();\n        }\n      } else {\n        flipped = true;\n        var _ = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = _;\n      }\n    }\n\n    var allEqual = true;\n    var bSize = b.__iterate(function(v, k)  {\n      if (notAssociative ? !a.has(v) :\n          flipped ? !is(v, a.get(k, NOT_SET)) : !is(a.get(k, NOT_SET), v)) {\n        allEqual = false;\n        return false;\n      }\n    });\n\n    return allEqual && a.size === bSize;\n  }\n\n  createClass(Repeat, IndexedSeq);\n\n    function Repeat(value, times) {\n      if (!(this instanceof Repeat)) {\n        return new Repeat(value, times);\n      }\n      this._value = value;\n      this.size = times === undefined ?

The object may contained nested data.\n\n * an Immutable.Map\n\n * a simple type such as an integer. This is a shorthand for supplying {\"value\": v}.\n\n**Example:**\n\nGiven some source of data that looks like this:\n\n```json\nconst sampleEvent = {\n    \"start_time\": \"2015-04-22T03:30:00Z\",\n    \"end_time\": \"2015-04-22T13:00:00Z\",\n    \"description\": \"At 13:33 pacific circuit 06519 went down.\",\n    \"title\": \"STAR-CR5 - Outage\",\n    \"completed\": true,\n    \"external_ticket\": \"\",\n    \"esnet_ticket\": \"ESNET-20150421-013\",\n    \"organization\": \"Internet2 / Level 3\",\n    \"type\": \"U\"\n}\n```\n\nWe first extract the begin and end times to build a TimeRange:\n\n```js\nlet b = new Date(sampleEvent.start_time);\nlet e = new Date(sampleEvent.end_time);\nlet timerange = new TimeRange(b, e);\n```\n\nThen we combine the TimeRange and the event itself to create the Event.\n\n```js\nlet outageEvent = new TimeRangeEvent(timerange, sampleEvent);\n```\n\nOnce we have an event we can get access the time range with:\n\n```js\noutageEvent.begin().getTime()   // 1429673400000\noutageEvent.end().getTime())    // 1429707600000\noutageEvent.humanizeDuration()) // \"10 hours\"\n```\n\nAnd we can access the data like so:\n\n```js\noutageEvent.get(\"title\")  // \"STAR-CR5 - Outage\"\n```\n\nOr use:\n\n```js\noutageEvent.data()\n```\n\nto fetch the whole data object, which will be an Immutable Map.\n*/\n\nvar Event = function () {\n\n    /**\n     * The creation of an Event is done by combining two parts:\n     * the timestamp and the data.\n     *\n     * To construct you specify the timestamp as either:\n     *     - Javascript Date object\n     *     - a Moment, or\n     *     - millisecond timestamp: the number of ms since the UNIX epoch\n     *\n     * To specify the data you can supply either:\n     *     - a Javascript object containing key values pairs\n     *     - an Immutable.Map, or\n     *     - a simple type such as an integer.

There are two basic types:\n * *Multiplier index* - the number of some unit of time (hours, days etc) since the UNIX epoch.\n * *Calendar index* - The second represents a calendar range, such as Oct 2014.\n\nFor the first type, a multiplier index, an example might be:\n\n```text\n    1d-12355      //  30th Oct 2003 (GMT), the 12355th day since the UNIX epoch\n```\n\nYou can also use seconds (e.g. 30s), minutes (e.g. 5m), hours (e.g. 1h) or days (e.g. 7d).\n\nHere are several examples of a calendar index:\n\n```text\n    2003-10-30    // 30th Oct 2003\n    2014-09       // Sept 2014\n    2015          // All of the year 2015\n```\n\nAn Index is a nice representation of certain types of time intervals because it can be cached with its string representation as a key. A specific chunk of time, and associated data can be looked up based on that string. It also allows us to represent things like months, which have variable length.\n\nAn Index is also useful when collecting into specific time ranges, for example generating all the 5 min (\"5m\") maximum rollups within a specific day (\"1d\").

Each row is at a different time (or timerange), and each value corresponds to the column labels.\n   \nAs just hinted at, the first column may actually be:\n\n - \"time\"\n - \"timeRange\" represented by a `TimeRange`\n - \"index\" - a time range represented by an `Index`. By using an index it is possible, for example, to refer to a specific month:\n\n```javascript\nvar availabilityData = {\n    name: \"Last 3 months availability\",\n    columns: [\"index\", \"uptime\"],\n    points: [\n        [\"2015-06\", \"100%\"], // <-- 2015-06 specified here represents June 2015\n        [\"2015-05\", \"92%\"],\n        [\"2015-04\", \"87%\"],\n    ]\n};\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can construct a `TimeSeries` with a list of events. These may be `Events`, `TimeRangeEvents` or `IndexedEvents`. Here's an example of that:\n\n```javascript\nconst events = [];\nevents.push(new Event(new Date(2015, 7, 1), {value: 27}));\nevents.push(new Event(new Date(2015, 8, 1), {value: 29}));\nconst series = new TimeSeries({\n    name: \"avg temps\",\n    events: events\n});\n```\n\n### Nested data\n\nThe values do not have to be simple types like the above examples. Here's an example where each value is itself an object with \"in\" and \"out\" keys:\n\n```javascript\nconst series = new TimeSeries({\n    name: \"Map Traffic\",\n    columns: [\"time\", \"NASA_north\", \"NASA_south\"],\n    points: [\n        [1400425951000, {in: 100, out: 200}, {in: 145, out: 135}],\n        [1400425952000, {in: 200, out: 400}, {in: 146, out: 142}],\n        [1400425953000, {in: 300, out: 600}, {in: 147, out: 158}],\n        [1400425954000, {in: 400, out: 800}, {in: 155, out: 175}],\n    ]\n});\n```\n\nComplex data is stored in an Immutable structure. To get a value out of nested data like this you will get the Event you want (by row), as usual, and then use `get()` to fetch the value by column name. The result of this call will be a JSON copy of the Immutable data so you can query deeper in the usual way:\n\n```javascript\nseries.at(0).get(\"NASA_north\")[\"in\"]  // 200`\n```\n\nIt is then possible to use a value mapper function when calculating different properties. For example, to get the average \"in\" value of the NASA_north column:\n\n```javascript\nseries.avg(\"NASA_north\", d => d.in);  // 250\n```\n */\n\nvar TimeSeries = function () {\n    function TimeSeries(arg) {\n        var _this = this;\n\n        (0, _classCallCheck3.default)(this, TimeSeries);\n\n        this._collection = null; // Collection\n        this._data = null; // Meta data\n\n        if (arg instanceof TimeSeries) {\n\n            //\n            // Copy another TimeSeries\n            //\n\n            var other = arg;\n            this._data = other._data;\n            this._collection = other._collection;\n        } else if (_underscore2.default.isObject(arg)) {\n\n            //\n            // TimeSeries(object data) where data may be:\n            //    { \"events\": [event-1, event-2, ..., event-n]}\n            // or\n            //    { \"columns\": [time|timerange|index, column-1, ..., column-n]\n            //      \"points\": [\n            //         [t1, v1, v2, ..., v2],\n            //         [t2, v1, v2, ..., vn],\n            //         ...\n            //      ]\n            //    }\n\n            var obj = arg;\n\n            if (_underscore2.default.has(obj, \"events\")) {\n\n                //\n                // Initialized from an event list\n                //\n\n                var events = obj.events;\n                var meta1 = (0, _objectWithoutProperties3.default)(obj, [\"events\"]); //eslint-disable-line\n\n                this._collection = new _collection2.default(events);\n                this._data = buildMetaData(meta1);\n            } else if (_underscore2.default.has(obj, \"collection\")) {\n\n                //\n                // Initialized from a Collection\n                //\n\n                var collection = obj.collection;\n                var meta3 = (0, _objectWithoutProperties3.default)(obj, [\"collection\"]); //eslint-disable-line\n\n                this._collection = collection;\n                this._data = buildMetaData(meta3);\n            } else if (_underscore2.default.has(obj, \"columns\") && _underscore2.default.has(obj, \"points\")) {\n                (function () {\n\n                    //\n                    // Initialized from the wire format\n                    //\n\n                    var columns = obj.columns;\n                    var points = obj.points;\n                    var _obj$utc = obj.utc;\n                    var utc = _obj$utc === undefined ?

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\nfunction TransformState(stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function (er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n  this.writeencoding = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb) {\n    return stream.emit('error', new Error('write callback called multiple times'));\n  }\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (data !== null && data !== undefined) stream.push(data);\n\n  cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(this);\n\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  if (options) {\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n  }\n\n  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  this.once('prefinish', function () {\n    if (typeof this._flush === 'function') this._flush(function (er, data) {\n      done(stream, er, data);\n    });else done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.
