=head1 NAME

motd_init_script - Displays a message of the day, and modifies the standard
/etc/motd to contain it.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This init script is meant to be called as the last possible init script. The
script displays a message to the user and modifies the /etc/motd to contain
that same message. The purpose is to give the user some instructions before
they login so that they have some idea of what to do. The message it gives
contains a url to the web gui. It constructs this url using the "external"
address. The template file for the motd is located in
"/usr/local/etc/motd.tmpl".
