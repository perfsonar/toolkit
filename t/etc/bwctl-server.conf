#			Example bwctld.conf config file.



# peer_port (port to open peer "server" connection on.) If this daemon
# is running the iperf "receiver" then it will also open a peer tcp
# connection using these port numbers. This extra connection is used to
# validate clocks between the two bwctld processes and to exchange results.
# Must be specified as a valid range with the first value less than the
# second. (A single value is only allowed if it is '0'.)
# (defaults to 0 - let the system pick an ephemeral port)
peer_port 6001-6200

# test_port (ports to run the test tool "server" on.) This is set to a range
# since some tests can run in parallel, and need to be able to open servers on
# separate ports. The daemon will cycle through this range assigning each ports
# to each test, as needed.
# (defaults to 5001-5900)

# run as group/user - only used if effective uid is root.
# (defaults to nil)
user		bwctl
group		bwctl

# root_folly needs to be set if the 'user' specified above has root

# run as root unless expressly intended.
# (You could uncomment this line... But are you really sure you
# want to do that?)
# (defaults to !root_folly)
#root_folly

# not really used, but what the heck.

# (defaults to $cwd)

# location for session files. (NOT USED YET)
# (defaults to $cwd)

# auth_mode - uncomment to make only Open.
# (defaults to OAE)
#auth_mode O

# allow_unsync - allow test requests to schedule even if the host is
# not syncronized, or the NTP system calls are not available.
# (defaults to False if NTP system calls unavailable,
# defaults to True if NTP system calls are available.)
#allow_unsync

# sync_fuzz - admin specified amount of time error (seconds). If NTP
# errors are suspect, set this to the amount of error you suspect.
#sync_fuzz 3

# src address/port defaults to wildcard addr and standard(not yet...) port.
# Can be specified as only a port number to still wildcard address and not
# use the semi-standard bwctl control port (':' must be the first non
# whitespace charactor in this case).
# Can specify the host without the port to use the default port.
#src_node localhost:8765
#src_node :8765

# die_by - amount of time to wait for child processes to gracefully terminate
# before killing them with a SIGKILL. (default is 5 seconds)
# This is in response to the master process receiving SIGTERM or SIGHUP.
# (defaults to 5)
#die_by 5

# control_timeout - amount of time (seconds) to wait for a protocol
# message.
# If you are using bwctl to run regular tests in a loop, make sure this timeout
# is significantly larger than the -I values you want to support or the
# daemon will close the control connection and cause bwctl to do extra work.
# (defaults to 7200) 2 hours - same as default for tcp keepalive
#control_timeout	7200

# bottleneck_capacity - this value is used in the algorithm to dynamically
# set the send/recv window sizes. This option is likely to be removed in
# the future once a dynamic bottleneck_capacity algorithm is incorporated into
# the code.
# (defaults to 0 - unused)
#bottleneck_capacity 1g

# posthook - a script to run after a session has completed
# There can be any number of posthook scripts. These scripts will be executed
# by the daemon when a session finishes. The script will be passed the test
# parameters, the receiver output and the sender output. An example script is
# included in the contrib directory that will send a message to syslog when the 
# session completes.
#posthook /path/to/script.pl
#posthook /path/to/other/script.pl
